A lab for the intro to networking course at OSU done in C. Worked with partner Derek DiCillo, to create a UDP server that receives a request for a file goes and gets that file from the file system, wraps a header around it, and sends it back to the client. We have also implemented a random number generator which imitates a "lossy" connection. This "lossy" connection is fixed with implementation of ACKs in part C.
